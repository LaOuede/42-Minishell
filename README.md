<h1 align=center>Miniêž©hell</h1>

<p align=center>
 The <b>FDF</b> project is a 3D wireframe renderer developed to visualize terrain maps using C programming language and the MLX42 graphic library.
 The project involves reading map files, calculating the appropriate heights for each point, and rendering a wireframe representation of the terrain.

<h3 align="left">What I've learned</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge on C programming :
- Command line parsing (tokenizer and parser implementation)
- Pipes
- Process creation and management (system calls : fork(), exec() and wait()
- Command execution (cd, echo, ...)
- Managing environment variables (export, unset)
- Input/output redirection
- Signal handling
- Error handling
- Managing memory
- Testing and debugging

What it taught me about teamwork :
- Collaboration
- Branching and merging (Git)
- Code review
- Issue tracking (Notion)

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again</h3>

- I would avoid void() function as they are not ideal for error status.
- I will distribute the work differently to get closer to the AGILE method.

Compilation :
```bash
make
```
