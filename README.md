<h3 align="left">What I've learned ðŸ“š</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge on C programming :
- Command line parsing (tokenizer and parser implementation)
- Pipes
- Process creation and management (system calls : fork(), exec() and wait()
- Command execution (cd, echo, ...)
- Managing environment variables (export, unset)
- Input/output redirection
- Signal handling
- Error handling
- Managing memory
- Testing and debugging

What it taught me about teamwork :
- Collaboration
- Branching and merging (Git)
- Code review
- Issue tracking (Notion)

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again ðŸ—’</h3>

- I would avoid void() function as they are not ideal for error status.
- I will distribute the work differently to get closer to the AGILE method.
